# Code-Refractor


## Description

This is an assignment in which I refractored the code for a marketing firm's website so that it was susinct and organized while maintaining the appearance.
This was done to follow accessibilty standards and optimize site for search engines. 
I did this by updating the divs to semantic html elements, and then reordering the css to be sequential.
These updates have provided user accessibilty and organization to easily identify the components of the page.
